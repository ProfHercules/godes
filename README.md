Copyright (c) 2013 Alex Goussiatiner agoussia@yahoo.com

# Features
Godes is the general-purpose simulation library which includes the  simulation engine  and building blocks for modeling a wide variety of systems at varying levels of detail.

#Advantages
* Godes is easy to learn for the people familiar with the Go and the elementary simulation concept
* Godes model executes fast  as Go compiles to machine code.
* Godes model is multiplatform as Go compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, etc
* Godes model can be embedded in various computer systems and over the network
* Speed of the GODES model compilation is high
* Variety of the IDE with debuggers are available for Go and Godes as well
* The GodesS simulation model can use all of the features and libraries of the Go
* Code Security- the GODES includes the  source code for the model,  Go is an open source project supported by Google

#Installation
*	Download, install and test the Go at your machine. See instructions at http://golang.org/doc/install
